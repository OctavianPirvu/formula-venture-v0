Belong,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/belong-336d,"Belong is a residential network that vertically integrates all aspects of the home rental and home improvement process. There is more than one American Dream. Owning your home is one of those dreams. It's been an aspiration for a long time, and we know that millions struggle to achieve it. But there are other American Dreams. Some of these dreams are about living differently than previous generations - for whom owning was everything. We may want to use our cash to start a business. We may want to experience new places. We may not have the money yet for home ownership, but still dream of living in a glorious home where we can put down roots and experience the sense of belonging. This is a new mindset. We are a community of people looking for a dream rental, and people who own properties and are looking for people who will love them. The old-school terms ""landlord""​ and ""tenant""​ don’t apply in our world. Here, there are people who want to adopt homes for a while, and people who have wonderful residences ready for them. Our owners are not giant holding companies that own thousands of homes and view them as pure financial assets. There's a level of mutual respect and caring in our world that simply doesn't exist in the transactional, brutalist world of landlords and tenants. We manage properties for our owners, and treat the people who live there with the attention, speed and concern they deserve. And we support those who are living an ownership-free lifestyle by creating a true community everywhere we are. Our residents are connected not only to each other, but also to the local merchants, events, and institutions that give communities their unique character. Before, renters often felt like second-class citizens; with us, they are an immediate and integral part of the community. So, whether you own property and you're looking for someone to live in it and love it, or you're looking for a home where you can put down roots – for however long you're planning to be there – we are the answer. Renting is the new American lifestyle. We didn’t create it, but we're making it sing.",Series C,"Consumer Software, Hospitality, Internet, Property Management, Real Estate, Residential, Service Industry","Andreessen Horowitz, Fifth Wall, Battery Ventures, WestCap, Notable Capital",2022-05-19,Active,https://belonghome.com/,a16z

Our mission is to decentralize social media the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralizing the financial system. As a layer-1 blockchain, DeSo can be compared to other blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, etc... However, DeSo has several major advantages over these platforms, the largest being that it is designed to power storage-heavy applications (like social applications and marketplaces). To put it in perspective, storing just a 200-character ""Tweet"" on Ethereum costs ~$80, and costs ~$0.25-$1.00+ on Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, and virtually all other smart contract chains. In contrast, it costs 1/1,000th of a penny on DeSo, which is why breakthrough apps like Diamond, DAODAO, Pearl, OpenProsper, NFTz, and Entre, now possible exclusively on DeSo. Today, social media is even more centralized than the financial industry was prior to the creation of Bitcoin. A handful of private entities effectively control public discourse, and earn monopoly profits off of content that they don't even create. Society’s answer to financial centralization was not to put Warren Buffett in charge of money, it was to use technology, namely Bitcoin, so we could have nobody in charge. We believe the same type of technology will cause this conclusion to ultimately play out in social. DeSo’s advantages make it capable of breaking this status quo for the first time, and bringing competition and innovation back to social in much the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum have done for our financial system.

451 Degrees,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/451-degrees,"451 Degrees is a machine learning and artificial intelligence platform. All participants in the Content Marketplace: Content Providers, Advertisers and Consumers have pains in the current system. Content Providers want to create enhanced engagement, know more about their viewers, deliver enhanced advertising and create simple, better Search Engine Optimization within their sites as well as in traditional Search Engines. Advertisers know there is an audience but they want to know the Articles, Images, Videos, Music and Products they are associated with fit all their marketing needs and do not create tensions. Consumers want a simple and easy experience that will also allow them to have a voice. Currently, there is too much unidentifiable or inappropriately labeled Articles, Images, Videos, Music and Product content on too many channels to properly make it all fit. Where and what is all this Big Data? 451 Degrees has created Graffiti, a Big Data software as a service (SaaS), that, without requiring any change to the original content, helps solve these issues and more. Graffiti follows content, whether it is an article, video, image, music or product, over multiple locations such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook plus others and analyzes all comments and info about that piece as an independent source and in symphony. Graffiti works with content publishers; news sites, video sites, image sites, product sites, blogs, e-commerce product sites and any one with comments or a desire to increase consumer engagement within their site. Big Data bringing Real Time results increasing revenues and relevance. Here’s how it works... Utilizing a simple bi-directional API, Graffiti analyzes large data sets so they can be used in a pro-active and revenue generating capacity to identify opportunities and strategies to better engage your consumer, deliver better advertising or product placement to your product and define all things properly. Graffiti is built to specifically analyze and redefine Internet content in REAL TIME by augmenting existing meta data with user generated comments. In short - Graffiti recognizes what is actually being said and its relevance by using patented Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) techniques. Most Articles, Images, Videos, Music Files or e-Commerce Products contain some original meta data placed on that content by the owners of that content. As a web based analytics tool and service, Graffiti will continually analyze these articles of content and update them with more relevant, truly organic, “meta tags” based on actual comments and what is really being talked about. These updates are automated in Real Time as new meta data. The content continues to evolve as the community Comments about it. This translates into the consumers ability to easily find the Articles, Images, Videos, Music Files and Products they seek. User commentary is better defined and assists the content owner with developing a true, instead of perceived or desired, set of tags originally placed by the content owner. What are the benefits to our Clients? Our core functionality allows our clients to analyze Big Data in Real Time, classify and redefine content by evaluating user comment based data generated through consumer engagement. This is no longer “junk” but the most useful element of any content. It is the audience of many brought into focus and use. The evaluation of Big Data, in the form of comments, in turn generates more true engagement which delivers stronger and more refined meta data to use when optimizing search (SEO) as well as Ad Delivery Networks (ADN) Key Word targets or Product Placement for every piece of content. Graffiti accomplishes this by collecting ALL comments available across the web and applying a proprietary algorithm to determine the most appropriate meta-tags and serving these refined meta-tags as a service in REAL TIME back to the original source. As well as to the Ad Delivery Network or Recommendation Engine for increased transaction opportunity in Real Time. This Ad Delivery Network can exist as a stand alone Below The Fold (BTF) ADN thus creating and entire new frontier of revenue inside a barren wasteland. These are found revenues that are proven to be of the highest values in Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Action (CPA) transactions. Who Can Use Graffiti? Graffiti works with businesses that wants to make deep learning sense of comments and other consumer commentary and use it for engagement and revenue generation practices. Our target clients are Content Owners, Media, Consumer Brands, BioTech, e-Commerce and multi-national Corporations as well as strategic partners with existing technology solutions where we can provide added value to their offering.

By designing non-disposable, core-of-your closet silk and lace essentials, we are returning to the industry’s roots of making things that matter, and things that last. By selling these collections directly to customers online, we’ve escaped a model that requires excessive markups to offer revolutionary, affordable pricing year-round – because you shouldn’t have to wait for the things you covet to go on sale, and you shouldn’t have to choose between quality and price. Creator-to-Closet Our founder and head designer Allison Beal takes an artisanal approach to her creative process. Each piece is designed in-house at StyleSaint’s design studios, manufactured locally in sunny Los Angeles, and shipped directly to you without retail markups. By focusing on quality over quantity and designing timeless collections that are meant to be worn year-round, we are taking the stance that fashion should be neither “fast” nor disposable.

Launched in March, 2009, it is a mobile and Web application that enables people to capture and share the moments of their lives, as they happen, in story form. Through location, photos and text updates, users can easily turn everyday life experiences into lasting stories that can be remembered, organized and shared. The user controls exactly who can see his or her story, ranging from total privacy to publicly visible, including optional broadcast via status updates on Facebook and Twitter. Whrrl v2.0 is available now as a free application through the iPhone App Store, and anyone can participate via the Web, SMS text, and digital cameras with an Eye-Fi wifi-enabled memory card. Whrrl v2.0 stories are collaborative: two or more people who are physically together can â€œjoinâ€ and contribute to the same story from their separate phones, allowing a single shared experience to be expressed from multiple points of view. In addition, each story has its own unique URL that can be easily shared. After the real-world experience ends, the story may be edited by the participants via the Whrrl website and shared with others through Facebook, Twitter and/or email. Whrrl v2.0 on the iPhone utilizes Facebook Connect for Mobile to allow Facebook users to bypass Whrrl v2.0 account creation and login with their Facebook accounts. Linking a Facebook account to Whrrl v2.0 also enables access to the userâ€™s Facebook friends list, ability to publish stories as status updates, and all photos taken through Whrrl can be automatically published to Facebook photos. For non-iPhone users, Pelago provides several ways to participate in Whrrl v2.0. First, any mobile phone user can create and update stories by sending SMS text and email messages. Second, people who own a digital camera and an Eye-Fi wireless wifi-enabled memory card can upload pictures taken with the camera in real-time to a Whrrl v2.0 story.

Visible Path,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/visiblepath,"Nipping at the heels of competitor [LinkedIn](http://crunchbase.com/organization/linkedin), Visible Path is a new incarnation of business social networking. Visible Path entered the market with a different way of organizing and displaying your business contacts. Instead of showing all of your extended contacts to all the contacts in your network like LinkedIn, Visible Path focuses more on strength of relationship between contacts to determine who can add who to their contact list. This effort precludes ""contact farmers"" from adding you simply for the sake of adding someone. In a smaller circle of contacts, your relationships are more meaningful and cannot be as easily diluted. In order to create this more discriminatory contact circle Visible Path collects information about all your contacts through a 6mb Microsoft Outlook plugin which tracks who you've sent emails to or have meetings with.  The more often you are in contact with someone through Outlook, the stronger the relationship and vice versa. People outside of Outlook can also be added to Visible Path, but must be done so by searching for them specifically. Since contacts are generally all made through Outlook, the business relationships you make are very real. Because Visible Path users do not have the option of seeing your extended network, a much higher percentage of your business contacts will actually be people you have conversed with. At its current state, Visible Path's Outlook plugin is prone to simply making all your office contacts your strongest. User's may email or have meetings with people in their office more consistently than they do with very important contacts who work for other companies or in different locations. In these cases Visible Path would incorrectly recognize the importance of your relationships. It's a fallacy that more contact with someone means you have a stronger relationship with them. Visible Path is currently looking into other methods to track relationship strength. Drawing data from phone calls and IM's is currently on their plate, but some way for the content of conversations needs to be analyzed for Visible Path to work without flaw. Business Networks are very helpful when all your contacts are meaningful. Unfortunately exposure to the web often causes networks to expand rather than become more useful.",Series B,"Computer, Social Media, Software","Menlo Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Esther Dyson, Integral Capital Partners, Caufield Angel Fund",2006-03-01,Active,http://VisiblePath.com,Kleiner Perkins

Their company values are centered on integrity, quality and service. They believe that a good software company is known for its products, but a great software company is also known for the way it interacts with customers, partners and employees. Evant was founded as a physical logistics company in 1994 by a team of industry experts including Stanford professor Dr. Hau Lee, with the goal of solving the most critical business problems that companies faced in the distribution of finished goods, whether a manufacturer, wholesale distributor or retailer. As companies began to reap the benefits of new applied science in their distribution systems in the mid to late 1990s, they also began to bolster their IT infrastructures. Evant led its customer base into this new technology era by developing sophisticated forecasting and replenishment and merchandising software solutions. Built on decades of sound logistics and distribution science, they helped their customers reduce inventory costs and raise service levels in record time. For example, Longs Drugs, their first software client, reduced its replenishment costs by more than 65% at its distribution center and more than 38% at its pharmacies in less than a year. These improvements significantly increased free cash flow, releasing more than $100 million in working capital that Longs used for other opportunities to increase earnings, including the acquisition of new chain stores.

All data can be moved across the ClearSky network to meet a variety of use cases including data center migration, load balancing, expansion into new regions, or disaster recovery. ClearSky has partnered with major public clouds to place hot and warm cache copies at the cloud edge. The result: customers get low-latency access to cloud instances, providing a new cost-effective option to run their most demanding workloads. The total cost of ownership (TCO) of storing data using the ClearSky service is about 1/3 the cost of managing it in a company’s data center on physical storage arrays. By leveraging the architecture and building redundancy into all cache layers and network paths, ClearSky is able to provide an enterprise-class service with guaranteed high availability. Industry-leading security technologies and best practices ensure that customer data is always protected and isolated from the moment it enters the ClearSky network. Customers simply plug into the ClearSky service to get the storage they need, when and where they need it, with the security, scalability, and resilience that a business depends on.",Venture - Series Unknown,"Cloud Computing, Data Center, Enterprise Software, Virtualization","General Catalyst, Polaris Partners, Highland Capital Partners, Akamai Technologies, Pear Tree Partners",2018-11-13,Closed,http://www.clearskydata.com,General Catalyst
